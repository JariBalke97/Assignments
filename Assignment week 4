# In this assignment, we will play around with functions and use the `fsolve` routine to solve an equation.
# 
# First, we need to import some libraries.
# 
# Recall that you need to have installed plotly for this to work. Further, you need to register at the plotly website.

# In[4]:

from scipy import optimize

from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot
from plotly.graph_objs import Bar, Scatter, Figure, Layout
init_notebook_mode(connected=True)
from numpy import arange


# Let us define the function $f(x) = x^2+c$ which is a function of $x$ for a given value of $c$.

# In[18]:

def my_function(x,c):
    return x**2 + c


# Now we would like to solve $x^2 + c =0$. As this is a simple equation, you can this analytically. This helps us to understand how `fsolve` works.
# 
# If you want to know more about `fsolve`, simply google "python fsolve".
# 
# For our purposes here, we call `fsolve` as `optimize.fsolve`, then we give a function and an initial value where `fsolve` starts looking for a solution. `fsolve` uses numerical techniques to find the "zero" of a function; it does not solve the equation analytically. Roughly speaking, it looks at a value of $x$ whether it is above or below 0. If it is below 0, it needs to change $x$ in such a way that $f(x)$ increases. It uses the derivative $f'(x)$ to figure out whether it should increase or decrease $x$ to get to $f(x)=0$. So suppose that $f(x) < 0$ and $f'(x) >0$ then it will increase $x$ (move to the right) to a solution to $f(x) =0$.
# 
# As `my_function` is actually a function of two variables ($x$ and $c$), we define a new "anonymous" function `lambda` that is only a function of $x$ and we solve for this function to 0. Say, we start looking for a solution at $x=1$, then we type:

# In[19]:

optimize.fsolve(lambda x: my_function(x,-2),+1)


# This only gives one solution? But with a quadratic equation, there are usually two solutions. In the following cell give the python command to give the other solution:

# In[20]:

optimize.fsolve(lambda x: my_function(x,-2),-1)


# Now try the following cell. Explain below why you get an error message; $x=0$ does not solve this equation?

# In[21]:

optimize.fsolve(lambda x: my_function(x,-2),0)


# You get two outcomes at once, which is not possible to run

# Now we let's consider another function, with $c = 2$ (instead of $c = -2$). Explain below why we get an error this time

# In[22]:

optimize.fsolve(lambda x: my_function(x,2),-1)


# This equation is not possible, because you get x² = -2, this doesn't work as x² always has a positive outcome.

# Now define the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ in python:

# In[23]:

def f(x):
    return x**-1


# and use plotly to plot this function for $x > 0$. Adjust the range for $x$ so that you get a "decent" graph.

# In[26]:

range_x = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) 
iplot([{"x":range_x, "y":[f(x) for x in range_x]}])
